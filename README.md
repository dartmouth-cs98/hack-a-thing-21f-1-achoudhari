# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
The technology I wanted to learn was WebRTC, and specifically how to use APIs that wrap the WebRTC API to make usage easier. The specific React library I focused on was [`Simple-Peer`](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer).

## What you built? 

I decided to build a small video chatting app that used `Simple Peer` to establish connections between two users of the app and enable video and voice communication in a simple chatting interface. In addition to video chatting functionality, the app also notifies a user when they are being called and allows a user to pick up, hang up, and end a call.
